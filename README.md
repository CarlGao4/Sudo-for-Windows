# Sudo-for-windows
This program can help you expediently run a program as administrator. 

## Usage
After installing the program, the program is added to path. You can simply run a command with `sudo ` at its begging so it will be ran as administrator. UAC (User Account Control) window may be shown if system settings is set. To change this, you can run `UserAccountControlSettings.exe` (you can find it at `C:\Windows\System32`).
